# paperwork-multiexport
export multiple documents from Paperwork

With this simple Python script, you can export multiple papers from [Paperwork](https://github.com/jflesch/paperwork).

It basically runs through the folderstructure reads the labels or the words, and exports the files to a given location.

~~Until now you *absolutely* *need* to specify the *location* of the Paperwork folder and the *destination* of the exported files!~~

Tested with Python 3.5
